# Python Script Summary

## What This Does
- **Terraform Configuration Generation from Okta Data:**
  - Retrieves Okta brands, themes, and domains using the Okta API.
  - Fetches application details when a brand specifies a default application.
  - Generates Terraform resource blocks for Okta brands, themes, and domains.
  - Produces Terraform data blocks for Okta applications (production only) based on a search by label.
  - Consolidates all resource and import blocks into a single Terraform configuration file.
- **Environment-Specific Generation:**
  - Supports both preview and production environments.
  - Uses conditional resource creation (via the `count` parameter) based on the environment.
- **Post-Processing:**
  - Optionally formats the generated Terraform file using `terraform fmt`.

## APIs It Calls
- **Okta Brands API:**
  - **Endpoint:** `/api/v1/brands` (constructed with the base URL)
  - **Method:** GET  
  - **Purpose:** Retrieve all brand objects.
- **Okta Themes API:**
  - **Endpoint:** Derived from each brandâ€™s `_links.themes.href`
  - **Method:** GET  
  - **Purpose:** Fetch themes associated with a specific brand.
- **Okta Application API:**
  - **Endpoint:** `/api/v1/apps/{app_id}` (for fetching application details)
  - **Method:** GET  
  - **Purpose:** Retrieve application details used for default application lookups.
- **Okta Domains API:**
  - **Endpoint:** `/api/v1/domains`
  - **Method:** GET  
  - **Purpose:** Retrieve domain objects associated with the Okta organization.

## What the Arguments Are For
- **Environment & Domain Configuration:**
  - `--preview-subdomain` / `--prod-subdomain`:  
    - Specify the subdomain for preview and production environments.
  - `--preview-domain-flag` / `--prod-domain-flag`:  
    - Choose the domain flag (e.g., `default`, `emea`, `preview`, `gov`, or `mil`) to determine the full Okta domain.
  - `--preview-full-url` / `--prod-full-url`:  
    - Directly provide the full URL for the Okta API for each environment; overrides subdomain/domain flag settings.
- **API Authentication:**
  - `--preview-api-token` / `--prod-api-token`:  
    - API tokens used for authenticating requests in preview and production environments.
- **Output & Formatting:**
  - `--output-file`:  
    - Path for the generated Terraform configuration file.
  - `--terraform-fmt`:  
    - If set, runs `terraform fmt` on the output file to format the Terraform code.

## What the Terraform Generated File Will Look Like
- **Locals Block:**
  - Defines local variables such as the Okta base URLs for preview and production, and a flag indicating if the environment is production.
- **Resource Blocks:**
  - **okta_brand Resources:**
    - Generated for each brand with attributes including name, removal of Okta branding, custom privacy policy URL, and default application details.
    - Conditional inclusion of default app attributes (only in production, with data lookups for applications).
  - **okta_theme Resources:**
    - Generated for each theme associated with a brand.
    - References the corresponding brand resource (using Terraform interpolation).
  - **okta_domain Resources:**
    - Generated for each domain fetched from the Okta API.
    - Includes attributes such as domain name, brand reference, and certificate source type.
- **Data Blocks (Production Only):**
  - Terraform data blocks for Okta applications are created to perform lookups by label.
- **Import Blocks:**
  - For every resource (brand, theme, domain), an import block is generated.
  - These blocks use a conditional `for_each` based on the environment (prod vs. preview) to map Terraform resources to their corresponding Okta IDs.
- **File Structure:**
  - The file begins with a header comment and locals declaration.
  - Resource blocks are concatenated with corresponding import blocks placed at the end in a consolidated section.
