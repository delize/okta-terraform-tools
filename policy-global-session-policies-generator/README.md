# Python Script Summary

## What This Does
- **Terraform Configuration Generation:**  
  - Generates a Terraform configuration file from Okta Global Session Policies and their rules.
- **Data Retrieval:**  
  - Fetches Okta policies and associated rules using the Okta API for both production and preview environments.
  - Retrieves group details for groups referenced in policy conditions.
- **Resource Generation:**  
  - Constructs Terraform resource blocks for sign-on policies and their rules.
  - Creates data blocks for Okta groups.
  - Uses conditional resource creation (via the `count` parameter) based on the environment.
- **Post-Processing:**  
  - Optionally formats the generated Terraform file using the `terraform fmt` command.

## APIs It Calls
- **Okta API Endpoints:**
  - **Policies Retrieval:**  
    - **Endpoint:** `/api/v1/policies?type=OKTA_SIGN_ON`  
    - **Method:** GET  
    - **Headers:**  
      - `Authorization: SSWS {api_token}`  
      - `Accept: application/json`
  - **Policy Rules Retrieval:**  
    - **Endpoint:** `/api/v1/policies/{policy_id}/rules`  
    - **Method:** GET  
    - **Headers:**  
      - `Authorization: SSWS {api_token}`  
      - `Accept: application/json`
  - **Group Details Retrieval:**  
    - **Endpoint:** `/api/v1/groups/{group_id}`  
    - **Method:** GET  
    - **Headers:**  
      - `Authorization: SSWS {api_token}`  
      - `Accept: application/json`
- **Terraform Formatting:**  
  - Executes the `terraform fmt` command via a subprocess if the option is enabled.

## What the Arguments Are For
- **Environment and API Configuration:**
  - `--preview-subdomain` & `--prod-subdomain`:  
    - Set the subdomains for preview and production environments.
  - `--preview-domain-flag` & `--prod-domain-flag`:  
    - Define the domain suffix (e.g., `preview` or `default`) used to construct the base URLs.
  - `--preview-full-url` & `--prod-full-url`:  
    - Provide the full base URL for the Okta API; these override subdomain/domain flag settings.
  - `--preview-api-token` & `--prod-api-token`:  
    - API tokens used to authenticate requests for preview and production environments.
- **Resource Naming and Output:**
  - `--prod-env` & `--preview-env`:  
    - Specify the environment prefixes for naming Terraform resources (e.g., "prod" or "test").
  - `--output-file`:  
    - The file path where the generated Terraform configuration will be written.
- **Optional Processing:**
  - `--run-terraform-fmt`:  
    - If specified, the script will run `terraform fmt` on the generated file to ensure proper formatting.

## What the Terraform Generated File Will Look Like
- **Variable Declaration:**  
  - Defines a variable `CONFIG` used to control resource creation conditionally.
- **Data Blocks for Groups:**  
  - Data blocks for Okta groups are created for both production and preview environments, using normalized group names.
- **Policy Resource Blocks:**  
  - Separate resource blocks for production and preview policies, each with:
    - A conditional `count` based on the environment.
    - Attributes such as `name`, `status`, `description`, `groups_included`, and `priority`.
  - Each policy resource is accompanied by an import block that maps the policy ID.
- **Policy Rule Resource Blocks:**  
  - For each rule, a resource block is generated with:
    - Attributes like `name`, `status`, `access`, `authtype`, risk behaviors, network connection, and various MFA settings.
    - References to the parent policyâ€™s ID.
    - Conditional resource creation based on the environment.
  - Each rule resource block is followed by an import block formatted as `<policyID>/<ruleID>`.
